WendyBlog is a sample program that implements Struts 1 and a MySQL database. 

The database has 3 tables: user, logininfo, and posting. 

WendyBlog can log a user in, create new users, allow a user to post to the blog and show the user either their posts or posts by all members. The posts are sorted by date in descending order. The app was developed with Tomcat 7. 

Possible further development includes adding the ability to reply to a post as well as logging out a user.
